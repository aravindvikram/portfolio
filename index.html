    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <p class="summary"><strong>Welcome to My Portfolio  I am seeking an opportunity in the competitive world.Â 
        for a role in cybersecurity. In cyber security, I learned about cryptography and cloud security. I also completed my 
        internship with Tutler Infinity. In that internship, I have learned about cloud security,penetration 
        testing, blue teaming, and DFIR (digital forensic and incident response). I also have some c
        ertifications in cybersecurity, which I mentioned below. I was seeking relevant opportunities 
        for myself. To gain more knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. I also completed training in 
        advanced incident response and threat hunting. </strong></p>

   <h1><li>Reverse Vending Machine </h1>
        
      <strong>  RVM is an innovative concept which has been introduced to help collect 
        recyclable materials and hence to boost recycling activities 
        The simulation of Reverse Vending Machine with fraud detection with 
        Capacitive Proximity Sensors and Infrared Photoelectric Sensors to detect 
        fraud.Reverse Vending Machine Process by accepting plastic items and gives Purified 100ml water and Mobile charging as a reward according to the 
        weight of plastic items </strong></p></li> 

<h1>      <li> Underwater Image Recognition Using Deep Learning</h1>
        <p><strong>The underwater environment is very complex. We usually use sensors, such as 
            sonar and cameras to collect underwater object information. 
            The recognition degree of cameras is higher than that of sonar, but higher computational complexity is required in analyzing the whole data. 
            Problem Solving 
            7.3 
            The autonomous intelligent underwater vehicle (AUV) is an underwater robot, which has the advantages of a large range of activities, safety, and intelligence, and has become an important tool for the completion of various 
            underwatertasks.The program is applied in an underwater robot; the real-time 
            detection results show that the detection and classification are accurate and 
            fast enough to assist the robot to achieve underwater working operation.</strong></p></li>

      
            
            
           <h1> <li> Internship in CyberSecurity.</h1> 

           <strong> <p> I have completed my Tutler Infinity internship in
            cybersecurity. During that internship, I learned and
            access management fundamentals, and I was confident
            a lot about cloud security, digital forensics and incident
            response (DFIR), penetration testing, and blue teaming.
            I also completed a certification on identity access
            management fundamentals
            Currently, I am also completed a course in TDFIR:
            Advanced Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and
            Digital Forensics   </strong>

            <li>Digital Forensic Investigation of cyber Attack</h1>

      <strong><p> Digital Forensics Investigation of a Cyber Attack
            This project presents the findings of a digital forensics investigation initiated
            by the Team upon the discovery of a USB drive near the company premises.
            The investigation aimed to identify any potential threats posed by the USB drive
            and gather evidence for legal proceedings The USB drive was collected and
            preservedas potential evidence. Strict chain-of-custody procedures were followed
            to maintain the integrity and admissibility of the evidence throughout the
            investigation process.
            Utilizing advanced forensic tools, including the Sleuth Kit, a comprehensive
            analysis of the USB drive was conducted. Various forensic techniques, such
            as file system analysis and keyword searches, were employed to identify and
            recover any potentially harmful files or artifacts. Deleted files were meticulous
            fast enough to assist the robot to achieve underwater working operation</strong>
